# small-RNASeq.ngs
An analysis pipeline for genome-wide small RNA profiling from NGS data.

Ds-Seq is a pipeline designed to carry out small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) analysis on high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) data using bioinformatics tools that are mainly command-line based. The pipeline carries out genome-wide sRNAs profiling and analysis, especially in host-pathogen interaction studies and can be started using a single command. A user has to supply all required files and also define parameters with a configuration file. Ds-Seq has a modular design for the following analysis: (i) NGS reads filtering (ii) differential expression analysis (iii) identification of conserved micro RNAs (miRNAs) (iv) prediction of novel sRNAs and (v) genome-wide host and pathogen sRNA profiling.
